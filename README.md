# StarFall
Initial try at digital rain

A first attempt at "Digital Rain", or more typically referred to as "the Matrix Screensaver".

Written in C# using the .NET framework, StarFall is actually two console solutions. The first solution handles the window for the rain effect, 
while another handles spawning said windows for each monitor detected.

Still a heavy WIP, may likely abandon for a more robust set of tools to accomplish this task.
